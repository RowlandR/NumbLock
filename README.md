# NumbLock
A Number Memorizing Game, All Versions are Included
Some of the Numblocks, Guessing versions 3-5, do not interface with 'Mem-NL.txt' correctly.
If you look at their formats in the program (the very top), you will be able to interface with them correctly
Most of my Notes are included at various stages in all of the files.
Numblocks 1-2 were scrapped and only interface with 'Memory-NL.txt'
